conda create -n devika python=3.10

# Activate the environment
conda activate devika

Had some compatibility issues with the packages, so I had to use current active python vesion of repo

# type which python to get the path of the python version
which python

# Install the packages
/Users/Checkout/anaconda3/envs/devika/bin/python -m pip install -r req
uirements.txt

# if mac use the following command to install the node package manager
brew install node

npm init playwright@latest 

#use typescript for the project and click enter for the rest of the options

playwright install --with-deps

# change the directory to the ui folder
cd ui

# install the node packages
npm install

# install the bun package manager
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

#  run dev using bun
bun run dev

# if it does not work, use the following command
source ~/.zshrc and reactivate the environment using conda activate devika


once done open new terminal and run the following command
Activate the environment using the following

 command conda activate devika
change the directory to the devika folder ( Not Devika folder)
cd devika

# run the following command to start the server
python devika.py  

# wait until you get devika is up and running message
Go back to the previous terminal and you can see and open it  http://localhost:3000/

you should be able to see the devika app running

# then got config.toml file and change the following
firstly go to https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/introduction and get the api key and 
change in place of google_search in the config.toml file

then go to https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/controlpanel/all
